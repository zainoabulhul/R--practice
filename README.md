# R Practice

This repository contains my practice scripts while learning **R programming**.  
I am currently taking an R beginner course and using this space to upload my progress.

## Scripts 
- **matrix_properties.R** → Creating a matrix in R and exploring its row names, column names, dimensions, attributes, and class.  
- **practice. R** → A simple script calculating the mean of a numeric vector.  

### Next Steps
I will continue adding:
- Scripts on vectors, lists, and data frames.  
- Practice exercises with basic plots and summary statistics.
